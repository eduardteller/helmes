## Codebase Critique

### Security
- Database credentials are left in the configuration file as plain text, which is extremely insecure. However, for this test exercise, it is acceptable. For real production applications, credentials should be stored in environment variables or a secure vault.
- The current database is an H2 local file database, which is not secure for production use. For real applications, a more secure database should be used, such as PostgreSQL or MySQLâ€”preferably hosted on a separate server to minimize potential damage if some systems get compromised.

### Tests
- Backend tests are present and cover the main business logic of the application.
  - API tests use `@WebMvcTest` to test the controller layer.
  - Service tests use Mockito to mock the repository layer.
- Currently, there are no frontend tests implemented in the project.

### Readability
- The code is well-structured and follows Java conventions.
- The code is easy to read and understand.
- Naming of classes, methods, and variables is clear and descriptive.
- Documentation is present but minimal.
